<p>DataGate Studio (DGS) provides database management utilities for DataGate databases. It snaps inside Visual Studio and its features include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Create database names</li>
<li>Create local DG databases</li>
<li>Create and change physical, logical, and print files</li>
<li>Perform simple database queries</li>
<li>Make minor changes to database data</li>
</ul>
<p>DGS installs by default with ASNA Visual RPG for .NET and it is available as a stand-alone install (generally intended for server installations). DGS is intended to be a developer feature and is not intended for end-users. It would be very easy for an end-user to use DGS to do potentially damaging things to a database. This is especially true for local DG Windows-hosted databases which have very limited security.</p>
<h3 id="database-archives">Database archives</h3>
<p>DGS also includes a database archive feature. Database archives provide a way to distribute copies of databases (or parts of a database) to other developers. This feature is intended almost exclusively for Windows-hosted (server or desktop) DataGate databases (sometimes called a &quot;local&quot; DG database). While DGS would theoretically work with IBM i and SQL Server databases, using DGS with these databases is discouraged.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Please note that DG database archives are not intended, and should <em>not be used</em>, as an alternative to database backup. For local DG databases we recommend using a high-quality Windows backup like Acronis, Genie, NovaBackup, Paragon, or other that you deem worthy. For IBM i and SQL Server databases we recommend platform-specific backup best practices.</p>

<h3 id="batch-import">Batch import</h3>
<p>DGS archive creation is not intended to be a batch-driven process. Exporting and important database archives is a point-and-click process and assumes DataGate Studio is available to do so.</p>
<p>That said, we have had a few customers using local DG databases ask for a way to import DGS archives from outside Visual Studio.</p>
